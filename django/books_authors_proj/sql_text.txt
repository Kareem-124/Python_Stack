ath.save()

Query: Assign the first author to the first 2 books:

ath.books.add(book.objects.get(id = 1))
ath.books.add(book.objects.get(id = 2))

Query: Assign the second author to the first 3 books
ath = author.objects.get(id = 2)
ath.books.add(book.objects.get(id = 1))
ath.books.add(book.objects.get(id = 2))
ath.books.add(book.objects.get(id = 3))

Query: Assign the third author to the first 4 books
ath = author.objects.get(id = 3)
ath.books.add(book.objects.get(id = 1))
ath.books.add(book.objects.get(id = 2))
